		    <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			  <p>In society today, technology has taken a huge roll in the world.  It is involved in everyone’s life and is changing the way of life for many people.  In most ways, this is a great thing but technology also has its negative effects on humanity, especially with the way children today live their lives.  Video games have begun to take on a larger role in the everyday lives of children and it is becoming a problem.  It is becoming a big enough problem that it is changing the way children today are developing.  It is causing them to be less social, have more aggressive personalities, and become less academically suitable for today’s world.  If the path continues to grow worse from where it is right now, the future will not be as bright as it was always thought to be.  The children today are the adults of tomorrow and change must come to better benefit the future lives they will come to live.</p>
