			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Grand Theft Auto is a video game that is played by millions of children, teenagers, and adults worldwide.  Grand Theft Auto is a first person game where the player of the game plays as a criminal in a city atmosphere.  The latest version of the game takes place in a replicated version of Los Angelos.  In this version, the player is to complete a storyline by accomplishing certain tasks.  The storyline of the game is very explicit and inappropriate for any teenager or child under the age of 17.  This is due to the fact that the tasks that must be completed to finish the storyline of the game include stealing cars, executing heists, and killing people.  Killing human beings in the game can range from killing other gang members as a part of the storyline to killing civilians that are living in the theoretical city.  There is a scene in the game where the character of the game tortures a person in order to gain information from them.  The scene is long, intense, and graphic.  The game also includes explicit language such a racial slurs as well as swear words that is inappropriate for children.  Sexual material is also involved in the game which includes partially nude scenes as well as activities such a entering strip clubs and having sexual encounters with prostitutes.  Narcotics can also be purchased and used in the game by the character the player of the game controls.  All of the stated activities that are either violent or are inappropriate to the younger audience or a combination of the two.  All of which can affect the minds of younger children in a negative way.  </p>
			<p>Grand Theft Auto is rated for mature players only according to the ESRB guidelines which is a rating system for video games on the market.  The mature rating on the game only allows an adult at the age of 17 and older to purchase the game.  Even with this rating, it has been found in a Nielson Games survey that 17% of the owners of Grand Theft Auto are between the ages of seven and 16.  When considering the game makers have sold 29 million copies of the game within the first six weeks it was released, this is a substantial amount of underage children playing the game.  In the same survey, it was stated that parents were the main contributors of buying the game for underage children.  Around 80% of the under age children in possession of a copy of the game said a parent had purchased it for them.  The remaining 20% of the under age children with a copy of the game was either purchased by themselves or bought for them by a friend or relative.  The fact of the matter is that millions of under aged children are getting their hands on Grand Theft Auto which is easily deemed as inappropriate for younger children.</p>
