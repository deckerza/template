			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Engineering is a very complicated field; it requires not only knowledge that is found in a classroom but the practical skills of knowing how to apply that same knowledge in the real world.  Every problem that engineers come across are problems to be solved on paper but will be used in real world production.  The world is full of problems that have an infinite range of what they could be pertaining to.  One engineer cannot solve all of the problems that engineers face.  There is just simply too much to know and take into account for that to be possible.  For each problem, specific knowledge must be known before it can be approached.  With this being the case, it causes for almost every engineer to become specialized in a specific subject to best allow for each to solve problems that certain knowledge is needed for.  There is a plethora of different types of engineers and it ranges from mechanical, electrical, chemical, agricultural, and many more.  Each has its own set of skills that must be known and types of applications that are used to solve each problem in each type.  Approximately 1.6 million engineers are employed in the United States alone.  Figure 1 below shows the top ten engineering specializations in the US and the number of employees contained under each.  Although the knowledge that must be known is different for each type, there are multiple major concepts to engineering that are followed by all of the different types.</p>
