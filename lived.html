		<h1>The Red Corvette</h1>
		<p>	The field of engineering is not an easy career path to take and with that in mind, it is hard to persuade one into.  It is a field that mathematics and science play a huge role in and must be mastered in order to be used to come up with solutions to solve technical problems in various different situations.  The challenge of engineering is creating solutions for such technical problems in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.  More specifically, mechanical engineering is used to find efficient solutions in the process of the design as well as the development of a product.  Mechanical engineering is one of the hardest types of engineering to graduate from at Michigan State University and the same is true for many colleges nation wide.  It is hard enough that it is recommended to take five years to get a degree rather than the more standard four.  There has to be more in it to pursue than just the paycheck so what is the reason I would choose the field mechanical engineering as my major?  The answer is simple: Cars.</p>
		<p>	Cars are the main driving force behind my choice in career paths.  I grew up with both my parents working for General Motors.  Bringing home a new company car every month or so was just a part of everyday life during my childhood.  I was fortunate enough to be able to experience so many different types of cars and trucks in all shapes and sizes.  My interest in automobiles began to grow and even as a kid I became a critic.  I began to see what I did and didn’t like in all these different cars.  I got to see what makes a car better or different from the others in a first hand view. </p>
		<p>	When I was first asked to think of why I was in the current major that I am in, the first thing to come to mind were following in my parents footsteps, but than I began to look deeper.  There is one memory in my head that sticks out and really seemed to be the defining point of where my small passion for cars turned into something bigger.  My passion for cars slowly grew throughout my childhood but it wasn’t until one sunny summer afternoon that my interest in cars really sparked.</p>
		<p>	I was eight years old playing basketball outside with some friends and all of a sudden a noise coming from the distance caught my attention.  The sound of a deep humming which seemed to be coming from a car as it drove down a street in my neighborhood.  It grew louder and louder as it approached and it grabbed not only my attention, but my friends’ attention as well.  Then it turned the corner onto my street and I could see it.  It was a beautiful brand new red corvette with the convertible top down.  My eyes lit up and a huge grin emerged on my face.  I couldn’t wait for it to pass my house so I could see it close up but as it approached it did something I was not expecting.  It slowed to a halt as it came up to my house and pulled into the driveway.  I was startled for a moment trying to figure out what was going on.  When I finally saw it was my dad sitting in the driver seat of the car, I burst out in excitement.  I’ve never had the chance to ride in such a fast car and I couldn’t wait another minute now that I had the chance.  I threw the basketball down and broke out into a sprint down my driveway and over to the car.  My dad didn’t even get the chance to turn off the car before I was at the window asking him if he could take me for a ride in it.  Laughing from my excitement, my dad said yes.  My dad spent that afternoon driving my friends and myself all around the city for what felt like hours and I could not have been happier.  Sitting in that corvette and feeling the engine rumble through your seat and hearing the roar of it as it takes off was one of the coolest things I could have dreamt of at the time.  Being sucked into the back of the seat when my dad went full throttle made butterflies in my stomach stronger than riding on my first roller coaster.  After a little while my friends began to grow tired and hungry and wanted to go home.  After we dropped them off I told my dad I didn’t want to stop riding around in the sports car.  I was still as excited to be driving around in a corvette as I was when it pulled into my driveway.  I was having the time of my life.  Once my dad finally pulled back into the neighborhood, I begged him to keep driving me around in the corvette but unfortunately it was getting dark and it was far past dinner time because we had been driving around for so long.  I could not wipe the smile off my face for the rest of the night after getting the chance to drive in that red corvette.</p>
		<p>	My interest in cars turned into an obsession after that experience.  I was always asking about cars, talking about cars, and wanting to learn more about them.  I spent hours a day looking through car magazines and looking up cars on the Internet.  My love for cars would continue to grow from that point on and the more it grew, the more I realized there is so much that goes into making a car than I ever imagined.  Realizing that only made my want to know more.  It made me want to know everything there was to know.  Cars have fascinated me throughout my lifetime thus far.  They are always changing and improving and there will always be more to learn.  With that being said, they will continue to fascinate me for the rest of my life. </p>
		<p>	When the idea of college started to come into the picture and having to choose a major, I couldn’t think of a better choice than mechanical engineering.  Mechanical engineers are the backbone to the automotive industry in the world today.  They are the ones who are on the cunning edge of creating new technology with automotives and are the ones that design the cars on the market.  Being able to work with something you love every single day is every person’s dream.  Working with, designing, and building cars would make me feel like that eight year old version of myself who got to ride around in that red corvette.  It has been my dream since that moment to have a part in designing and creating a car that would be sold worldwide.  I have been extremely fortunate to have the ability to pursue this dream.  I have never really thought of doing anything else with my life other than working with cars and it is the one piece of technology that has brought me to the career path I am pursuing today.</p>
