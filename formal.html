			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Engineering is a field that heavily relies on the use of science and mathematics to come up with solutions to technical problems.  As with any major, research and communication are skills that are a must know.  Research is extremely important for engineers as for solutions for present problems are often solved by looking at previous information of the past.  This information is usually kept within technical writing papers due to their ability to pass along information better than most other writing forms.  Technical writing is one form of communication but one thing that is also crucial for engineers is the ability to work with others.  A large portion of engineering is done in groups and it is not done by individual efforts alone.  To become a successful engineer, it is very important to learn the correct skills of research as well as communication in the job environment.</p>
