			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The expected effect of the proposed solution of parents becoming more involved has the potential to make extremely positive effects.  If parents keep their children from playing violent video games it could decrease the amount of violent and aggressive thoughts that get transmitted to children.  A second way more involved parents would effect children would be by limiting the amount of playing time that allowed for video games.  If they limit the time, it causes children to spend more time on other activities.  These other activities would include being with other children their age and it would allow for social skills to develop properly.  It would also allow for children to spend more time doing physical activities such as sports, which means exercise.  It would reduce that amount of overweight children caused from excessive time playing video games.  Parents becoming more involved would be the easiest and most effective way in reducing the negative effects toward developing children.</p>
			<p>The expected effect of banning or making stricter regulations also has the possibility for strong positive effects as well.  It would keep children from developing negative effects of violent video games by simply not allowing extremely violent and inappropriate video games from being able to be made or purchased. The negative effect of having aggressive or violent thoughts and personalities caused from playing violent video games goes away. </p>
