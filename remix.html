		<h1>Advertising: A World Enterprise</h1>
		<p>The project that our group had decided to create the video about was the major of advertising.  The best way to implement this into a video was to create a documentary form video that was based off the formal research project.  With this in mind, we had to come up with a way to not only inform about advertising but also to give audience of incoming freshman an idea of what to expect here at Michigan State University.  The multimedia project had caused for our group to look deeper into advertising than what was previously done for the written version.  The reason this had to be done was to have a greater understanding of advertising as a whole group for us all to contribute and create the best quality video.  The of informing about advertising was simple but the main problem of the video was coming up with a way to show a incoming student what to expect.   After collaborating on how to do this, it was decided that an interview with a current student was the best way to do this.  It had not only given the audience an idea of what to expect but also it gave great information and tips on what to do in order to become a successful advertising student and in the advertising job force.  </p>
		<p>The issue of what do base our video off of was decided after the first brainstorming session with the group.  Advertising was decided to be the most interesting major and there were many ideas of ways to keep the video informative as well as interesting.  The idea of it being a documentary was easily decided because the video had to be informative and documentaries are the best way to get information across to the audience.  The main issue that came up with myself and the project was that I did not know very much information about advertising prior to the assignment.  To make myself a useful contribution to the project I had to heavily research the subject.  Researching the subject was the first part of the systematic approach and from there, our group when into brainstorming ideas for the video.  After the final script was set for the video, taping and editing had followed until the project was completed.  </p>
		<p>The sources that proved to be the most beneficial to my research were mainly informative pages on advertising.  This had given me background knowledge on the subject as well as provided interesting facts to include in the video.  I had also attempted to look up videos of advertisements and although they were good additions to put into the video for explanatory purposes, it did not aid in research of advertising.  </p>
		<p>The interactions that our group had made were primarily meeting together.  Working as separate parts and trying to bring the project together at the end was simply not an option.  Everyone had to be present to create and become apart of the video and meeting was the best way to brainstorm.  The creative criticism had a large part in producing a better video which was another reason meeting in a group was important.  Working in groups was the most ideal way to produce this project.  It made for multiple people to include in the video and also allowed for greater brainstorming to be done to create the best video.</p>
		<p>The planning of the project was okay but could have been planned better.  We had given ample amounts of time each time we met to get the project done but we had waited until the last week to actually start our video.  Should I have the opportunity to do the project again I would have moved the whole process forward to allow for the video to be finished earlier to allow for more time to edit the video.  The main reason why this could not be done was because of conflicting schedules.  It wasn’t until the final week before the due date that everyone was able to meet the times that were needed to complete the project.</p>
		<p>When looking at the documentary, I believe the most effective aspect was that background information was given first.  It had given the audience the knowledge required to understand the proceeding parts of the video.  This would be especially important when considering the audience would be college freshman who do not always know a large amount of the major they are applying to go into.  When making the design decisions, everything was made as a group and everyone had saw the reasoning behind putting the information on the field first.  Once the basic knowledge was learned, we went deeper into depth on the different types of advertisements.  After, our group had decided the best way to pull the whole video together and to complete it was with an interview.  It fulfilled the purpose of the project and it had a thoughtful analysis of advertising at the end to finish the video in good manner.</p>
