			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Developing children in today’s world are becoming less involved in social activities of the past, such as playing outside or playing sports, and are spending larger portions of time playing mindless video games.  Many issues have arisen from children playing video games for extended periods of time.  Such issues include the development of poor social skills, overweight children from playing video games rather than physical activities, and a tendency for a decrease in attentiveness to school.  Extremely violent video games not only cause these issues, but they also cause another set of issues.  These issues are that children who play violent video games usually grow a violent personality as well as have aggressive thoughts.  The effects of violent video games are bad towards teenagers but these same effects are detrimental to developing children that don’t necessarily know the difference between right and wrong.  Even though there are age ratings on video games, this does not stop young children from playing violent video games.  This is caused from a mix between parents buying games for their children without knowing the consequences of it or the children get someone else to purchase the game for them.  Overall, violent video games causes a variety of problems for young children and it is important to bring change to minimize the effects of these video games on future children.</p>
