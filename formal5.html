			<h1>Technology</h1>
			<p>The advancements of technology in recent years have shown how much of a crucial aspect they are in engineering in today’s world.  These types of technology range from 3-D software and simulators.  Looking back 30 years before any of these technologies were ever invented, the process of engineering was done mainly by hand.  This had caused for the engineering process to waste time and resources when looking at it from today’s perspective.  30-40 years ago, the process for engineering new and updated material generally took on average around two years.  Such processes were also performed by much larger groups of engineers, sometimes ranging from full departments that in today’s world would be assigned to groups of around 5-6 engineers.  The tasks to be performed today have also decreased a substantial amount when considering the amount of time given to solve problems.  Generally, engineers are given around six months to solve problems they had around two years to complete before.  Technology has a huge role in changing the ways of engineering from the past and has become a part of improving engineering today.</p>
			<p>The first major piece of technology that has made the biggest impact is the invention of 3-dimensional and simulation software.  The 3-D software allows for someone to create a simulated product on a computer in 3 dimensions and view it in any way that is wanted as well as being changed whenever needed with hardly any work.  Before 3-dimensional software was implemented in engineering, everything was done by hand.  All of the drawings that were made in the process of creating a product were done using straight edges and protractors.  The main reason how this software has improved engineering in today’s perspective is that it takes substantially less time to create a drawing.  What took days to create one view of a drawing only takes minutes to create on the 3-dimensional software.  With the 3-dimensional software, it also allows for any view of the projected product to be viewed while this cannot be done in a hand drawn image.  </p>
			<p>The simulation software that is used today has also made a huge impact on engineering.  What this software does is it allows for the testing of multiple different aspects as if it were a product in real life and allowing for it to be tested an infinite number of times.  If a certain product was made or a certain part of a product is modified, it shows how it will react under conditions it must be able to withstand.  As stated in an interview with an automotive engineer, just one aspect of engineering of cars has been improved to an amazing extent.  When looking at the crash testing of cars in recent years before the software, car companies were spending millions of dollars using production cars and crashing them in multiple different ways to make sure they meet safety standards.  Now with the simulation software, car companies are able to test how cars will withstand impacts on the computer.  This saves a substantial amount of money by not having to waste so many cars on testing a well as a large amount of time.  What used to take months to test one car hundreds of times could take a matter of minutes with the simulation software.  It also allows for the engineers working with the software to know exactly what parts are failing requirements and which parts are working correctly.  The computer software will catch things that a real life inspection may not see.  This is just one of the infinite number of ways simulation software is used by engineers and each one creates a substantial improvement to how engineering has changed in recent years.  </p>
			<p>Technology in the world of engineering today is undeniably the biggest improvement in recent years.  It has made an improvement on time, money, and resources that were seemingly wasted before the technology was invented.  It has caused for groups of engineers of 5-6 people could replace full departments at companies.  It has allowed for projects to take substantially less time which has made for improvements in engineering to vastly increase.  Technology is a huge part of engineering today and it is what has made products created by engineers improve at the rate they are today.</p>
