			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There is a multitude of way in which it is possible to lessen the negative effects of video games towards younger children; the first is through parents. The best and most effective way of how to lessen the negative effects of video games would be to keep children from playing such violent and inappropriate games that are rated for ages older than them.  In a previously stated Nielson Games survey, parents are the biggest facilitators of mature rated games to their children.  This could be a reason of lack of understanding of what is contained in the game or not caring about the rating of the game due to a lack of knowledge of the negative effects of the game on younger children.  Parents must take the effort and be more informed on what their children are involved in. A second solution to the problem would be for stricter regulations on what can be put into video games on the market today.  Getting parents involved would contribute a huge amount of negative effects on children from playing video games but not every parent worldwide is capable of doing this.  If stricter regulations are made on the amount of violence or inappropriate content allowed in video games then it would keep even children with un-knowledgeable parents from playing games that are not suitable for their age level.</p>
