			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Extremely violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto are detrimental towards the developing mind of younger children.  The main reason behind this is because younger children have a tendency to imitate what they see around them.  If they spend countless hours playing a game like Grand Theft Auto, they could begin to imitate the aggressive characteristics of the game.  Based off a Gentile, Lynch, Linder & Walsh study conducted in 2004, children who play video games for extended periods of time are generally more aggressive, are more confrontational to their peers, and have been shown to have a decline in academic abilities.  All of these negative effects are directly linked to video games.  </p>
			<p>Playing an excessive amount of video games takes time away from letting younger children do other activities.  These activities include playing outside, being around other children, and playing sports.  This can cause a variety of issues with the first being it can cause a huge lack of social skills.  If time that should be spent socializing with other children is spent playing video games than the development of social skills is not there.  Younger children will gain social experience through going to school but if a large amount of time is spent playing video games in their free time than there will be a lack of the ability to socialize which is a huge skill to not have a good grip on.  It will affect them for the rest of their lives if it is not learned during childhood.  The second issue with extensive amounts of time being spent playing video games is it keeps younger children from playing sports and other physical activities.  A lack of physical activity means a lack in exercise.  This being considered, children can become overweight if playing video games takes up a large portion of their time.  Video games are time consuming and if the time taken to play these games is extensive than it takes away from activities that younger children to be involved in to allow them to properly develop.</p>
