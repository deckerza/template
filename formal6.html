			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>Everything in engineering builds off one another.  With that being said, research is the backbone to current decisions that are being made to either improve or create a new product.  With a major that is almost solely based on factual information as well as calculations, research plays an enormous role.  It is apart of everyday lives of engineers in todayâ€™s world.  Just like there are engineers that are generally specialized in the major divisions of engineering, they must become even further specialized on each individual problem that is faced.  It is extremely important to obtain as much knowledge as possible about information that pertains the problem at hand.  This allows for the best possible decisions to be made to come forth with a solution. Researching each individual topic is an incredible help to most effectively manage time in the continually shorten span to solve problems.  It keeps from mistakes that were already previously tried from being made again as well as possibly being shortcuts to aid in the process.</p>
			<p>Technical writing is a major type of communication that engineers are responsible for and there is a reason for this.  Information given in this form allows for it to be passed along in a very efficient and understandable manner.  It is one of the best possible ways for knowledge to be gained in a written form.  It becomes information that can be passed on for generations and it is one of the main sources that engineers turn to in order to become knowledgeable on a subject.  It shows first hand experiences, calculations, and facts all of which can be a large help to current projects.  </p>
			<p>Research is one of the main reasons engineers are so successful in the job environment today.  It is essential to learn to correctly research to make for the best use of time and money.  With engineering being a field that is based so highly off of calculations, it is essential that the proper research has been performed to allow for the correct calculations to be made.  Every aspect of a design must be correct in order for it to succeed and complete the task at hand.  It is simply impossible for an engineer to know everything about a current problem but research is the way one is able to become knowledgeable enough to find a solution.  </p>
