			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Zachary Decker, Zack for short, and I am from Rochester Hills, Michigan.  I am a freshman at Michigan State University currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  During my first year here, I have started a fraternity here on campus and I have also committed a huge amount of time to the MSU Formula SAE team.  Formula SAE is a collegate student-run organization that builds a scaled down formula one race car and competes against other colleges around the world.  I thought it would be a great team to join considering I will be doing similar work in my future job I hope to have as an automotive engineer.  After spending a year on the team I really can't see myself doing anything else than working with cars and automotives.   </p>
