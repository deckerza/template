		<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
		<p>As a freshman, a first year writing course could be somewhat of a daunting task.  As for a good majority, writing is not a strong suit and an even larger majority of engineers would say they are not very fond of it.  Writing is apart of everyone’s everyday life, from writing in the job environment or even as a leisure activity.  It is the reason why it is so important in the education process to learn the many concepts that are used to create an adequate paper.  Throughout the WRA 110 course we are required to complete five projects that ranged in difficulty as well as purpose.  Ultimately the goal is to teach different aspects of literature as the forms of the projects change.  The first project was composed of a narration of a personal experience of your own.  The second had consisted of creating an argumentative essay off of a technological artifact of your choosing.  Finally, the last project covered the aspects of technical with the production of a research paper.  The fourth project took away from the writing aspect and focused more to show how information can be passed along in other forms such as a video or a clip.  Each project had a specific purpose to cover such a broad topic of literature and develop a student that not only can be capable of doing such tasks, but also have a greater understanding of what it means to create each piece.  </p>
		<p>The first of five main projects in the WRA 110 course was the lived experiences project.  The purpose of the project was to create a paper in the form of a narration of a personal experience of your own that has reared you into the major that you are pursuing.  The guidelines to this project were broad allowing for creativity and an informal tone to be used in the paper.  Narrations are required to be presented to all different types of audiences, which has caused for the informal tone to be the correct choice.  It wasn’t a hard choice to make me decide what had caused me to get an education as a mechanical engineer as a big passion of mine is automotives.  The problem was coming up with one specific point in my life that had really sparked that passion.  An activity was created to help in the process and it had made the decision clear as to what personal experience I was going to share in the project.  Although narrations are thought to be easier to compose, as it is informal, the challenge for myself was completing the minimum word count.  What it had caused for me to do was to integrate details into the writing piece for the purpose of almost recreating the vision through words.  It has shown that details are what make a good paper turn into a great paper and especially in the narration form.  When reading a narrative, the purpose is to create an image for the reader and for it to be understood by all audiences and the lived experiences project has allowed for me to learn the skills necessary to create such a narration.</p>
		<p>The second project that was the cultural analysis with the purpose of showing the aspects needed to create an argumentative essay.  The information required in the paper was to find an artifact with a technological background that has created a social issue and argue the validity of the side you are defending.  The differences in this project compared to the first were that it was not a narration but was based off of personal opinion.  The difficulty of this was looking deeper than just opinion and put together a compelling argument to back the opinion you have chosen.  A small amount of research was necessary in completing this project as facts and statistics that are not generally known was needed to support my argument.  The objective of my paper was to show that the social artifact of video games has a negative effect on the children and young adults that are playing them.  When creating the paper, it was easy to come up with reasons behind my opinion but the research was required to further back my opinion with accurate information.  With argumentative essays, it is important to also give points that would seem to support the opposing viewpoint and create counter points to these.  It keeps the paper from becoming biased and one-sided and creates for a more compelling argument.  Throughout completing the cultural analysis project it has allowed for me to learn and gain that skills of what it takes to create a strong and convincing argumentative essay.</p>
		<p>The third project that was to be completed was the Formal Research paper.  The guidelines to the project was to create a paper that would be presented to theoretical incoming freshman students and intended to describe the ways in which research and communication are conducted within your major.  This project was different from the previous two in multiple ways.  This paper is based off of extensive research leaving no room for opinion.  With this in mind it had cause for the informal forms that were used in the previous two papers to not be an option.  Learning the skills of researching was the largest purpose of this paper.  This was my major difficulty with the project.  A large help with my lack of research skills was the activity that had showed through trial and error the correct ways to research.  This assignment was extremely beneficial to me as it had taught me how to best search for the information that I wanted to incorporate into my project.  This project not only improved on my ability to research but also of how to analyze the information that I research and put it into words.  The ability to analyze information is such an important skill for everyday life.  This project has gone past the concepts of literature and gave me information that is extremely beneficial to my college career and myself.  It has allowed for me to look at what skills are necessary beyond writing for my own major that I am pursuing. It has given me a better incite on what I can expect from my major in the next few years at college that I had not previously known.  The formal research project has in turn taught me not only how to research and create a complete and accurate research paper but has also given me information of how to better myself as a student in my field, which are both extremely beneficial.</p>
		<p>The fourth project was completely different that all of the previous projects in its form.  The remix project had called for us to create a video that incorporates one of our past three projects.  The purpose of this project was to not only show how information can be passed along in more than one medium but also teach the skills of how to do this.  It required, through collaboration in groups, to get all of the same points across through action and dialect.  This was not the only purpose of the project as it had also taught the valuable skills of working with others and team management.  Working with groups causes for a discussion of ideas, which allows for a broader range of brainstorming but also causes conflicting ideas.  Learning how to resolve conflicting issues is a valuable skill for anyone and it is a skill that is used in everyday life as well as in the job environment.  The multimedia remix project was beneficial in both the ability to collaborate in groups as well as shown the ways in which information can be passed through in different mediums that just words on a paper.</p>
		<p>Literature is such an important aspect in anyone’s life.  It is something that is apparent in the job environment as well as in everyday activities.  When it comes to education, reading and writing are huge aspects that need to be learned and mastered in order to succeed in any major.  Taking this WRA 110 course has given me the skills needed to create all different forms of writings including narratives, argumentative essays, as well as technical research papers.  It taught me the concepts that are needed in each form of these forms in order to create a strong and compelling paper.  It has also shown me that information does not always have to be passed through words and has given me the skills to share information through other mediums.  It is not typical through a writing class to learn about more than just literature but this class has improved on my current skills of collaborating with others in groups.  It has also given me a deeper look into my own major and what I can expect in the next few years that I am a student.  This writing class has helped me improve as a student overall and has given me the skills to not only be successful in the field of literature while I am in the college environment but even beyond that to the job environment as well as everyday life.</p>
