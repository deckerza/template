                        <h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
                        <p>     The purpose of this video is to promote that homosexuality is not wrong.  To show that homosexuals
                        suffer a great amount from all the hate that is given to them by people in the world that dont agree
                        with it.  To help people who are homosexual that things do get better and that suicide or other types
                        of self harm are not the answer.  To show that everything will be okay.
                        The video attempts to achieve this purpose was through reading a letter that Randy writes to his Uncle
                        that had passed away from a self inflicted gun shot wound.  The reason how this is relavent to the purpose
                        that Randy is trying to get across is because his Uncle was gay.  The reason why he had committed suicide
                        is from how much hate and resentment he had recieved from everyone who knew that he was gay.  This included
                        his father especially.  It shows that because of how much he suffered from all this hate that he though 
                        his only option was to commit suicide just to get away from the pain.  He relates it to himself and how
                        he feels that he is in the same shoes because his mother never wanted a gay son either just as his uncle
                        Ronnie's father never wanted a gay son.  He explains how bad it was and how much hurt he felt when he fist
                        announced that he was gay.  He tells that he feels in the same position that his uncle was in but in his case
                        he did not choose suicide.  He chose to live and he explains that things do get better.
                        The structure of the message is presented by first reading a poem that he had said stuck with him 
                        for most of his life.  Than he reads the letter that he wrote to his Uncle that had shared the same 
                        situation that he is currently in that realates to homosexualtiy and the hurt that he feels from being
                        that way.  After the video cuts out and that it starts again and it is him 5 years into the future and 
                        tells that it does get better.  After he puts out bold statements to really make an impact with the video
                        and emphasize his points.
                        The video structure can help me revise my Lived Experience Project by allowing me to explore that there are
                        different ways to structure my paper.  That I can switch things around and make it unknown what the purpose
                        of the paper is until the end when I tie it all together.</p>
