                        <p>     The purpose of this video is to promote that homosexuality is not wrong.  To show that homosexuals
                        suffer a great amount from all the hate that is given to them by people in the world that dont agree
                        with it.  To help people who are homosexual that things do get better and that suicide or other types
                        of self harm are not the answer.  To show that everything will be okay.
                        The video attempts to achieve this purpose was through reading a letter that Randy writes to his Uncle
                        that had passed away from a self inflicted gun shot wound.  The reason how this is relavent to the purpose
                        that Randy is trying to get across is because his Uncle was gay.  The reason why he had committed suicide
                        is from how much hate and resentment he had recieved from everyone who knew that he was gay.  This included
                        his father especially.  It shows that because of how much he suffered from all this hate that he though 
                        his only option was to commit suicide just to get away from the pain.  He relates it to himself and how
                        he feels that he is in the same shoes because his mother never wanted a gay son either just as his uncle
                        Ronnie's father never wanted a gay son.  He explains how bad it was and how much hurt he felt when he fist
                        announced that he was gay.  He tells that he feels in the same position that his uncle was in but in his case
                        he did not choose suicide.  He chose to live and he explains that things do get better.
                        The structure of the message is presented by first reading a poem that he had said stuck with him 
                        for most of his life.  Than he reads the letter that he wrote to his Uncle that had shared the same 
                        situation that he is currently in that realates to homosexualtiy and the hurt that he feels from being
                        that way.  After the video cuts out and that it starts again and it is him 5 years into the future and 
                        tells that it does get better.  After he puts out bold statements to really make an impact with the video
                        and emphasize his points.
                        The video structure can help me revise my Lived Experience Project by allowing me to explore that there are
                        different ways to structure my paper.  That I can switch things around and make it unknown what the purpose
                        of the paper is until the end when I tie it all together.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 2: In Class Activity 2</h1>
                        <p>The video that was watched was a show of South Park that involved all of the characters obsessively involved in a video game.  It not only showed the kids being extremely into the game but also the parents.  With that being said, it seems that the group of people that is being targeted from this video is children and adults that play an extensive amounts of video games.  The video depicts the social issue that video games have to ability to capture people.   This can become as extreme as almost being another part of their lives.  They devote time to video games that they should be to other activities.  The people that get too into video games begin to loose a sense of hygiene and gain weight because all they do sit around and eat food.  One interesting aspect that was implemented into the video was the creators of the game.  Although they seemed so involved and into making the game and keeping it alive, they didn’t play the game themselves.  It showed the video game creator to have a “life” and didn’t play video games while they made the games for children to get attached to and have no “life”.  The video almost made the creators seem to encourage the social issue at hand because it was their source of income.  </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 3: In Class Activity 3</h1>
                        <p>The advertisement during the super bowl for the Chrysler 200 is a very well put together and effective advertisement.  The most effective aspect of this advertisement is that of pride and inspiration.  There are a few different ways the advertisement has incorporated this and the first is through the imagery.  Most Americans know of Detroit and the idea that it is a beat down city the almost scary reputation that it has.  The imagery at the beginning of the clip shows this story that most believe but the voice over begins to tell a different story.  It tells of how the history has made it tough, tougher and better than any other city out there.  The imagery works hand and hand with this and begins to show the images of the great aspects of Detroit.  The idea that it is tough gives a sense of pride for not only the people that live in or around it but for America itself.  It gives the sense that America built the city to what it is today and it shows that America is tough itself.  The ad finishes off with the line “Imported from Detroit”.  With the world today having so many imports from other countries, it gives the sense of pride that Americans made that car.  It shows that because Americans made the car, it is just as tough and reliable as what it gives the image Detroit and America is today.  It gives Americans watching the clip a sense of pride and ruggedness and this is what makes the watcher want to buy the car.  It shows a sense of pride to drive a car that was made right here in the motor city and it won’t have a cheap feeling but a luxurious feeling behind it.  The advertisement is effective because it makes American’s proud that they made that car and it makes them want to drive it.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
                        <p>It has been a crazy past few days considering the weather conditions.  A snow day rarely happens at college and to have two in a row or even in a year is almost unheard of.  The first class was cancelled because of this.  We received an email partially explaining the first project but I still have a lot of questions about it.  The assignment is the Lived Experiences and it is a narrative about a memory in your life that relates to the reason why you are pursuing your major.  It had seemed to be an informal paper making it seem simple enough to compose.  The main aspect of the project that seemed to be a challenge was putting it in the form of an html website.  I have no idea how to do this or where to even start and it seemed like a very daunting task.  I figured that this portion of the project would be further explained in class so I wasn’t too worried but a drafting activity was suppose to be written in preparation to completing the paper.  The drafting activity really helped when I was brainstorming for the paper.  I didn’t have an idea of what memory could relate to my paper but through the drafting activity I was able to think of a time where one did.  It made me think back to when my dad brought home a corvette from work and how it had really inspired me to become interested in the major of mechanical engineering.  </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
                        <p>Today is the first day of class and we were introduced to GitHub which is the website that we would create our html website off of.  It seemed very confusing and it seems like it will take a lot of work to get a hold of it.  The assignment was to begin working on Code Academy which is a online class to teach how to use an html website and it seems like it should help.  I began to work on it after class and it did make GitHub seem a little easier than first expected.  Another part of the assignment for that class was to continue to work on our Lived Experiences paper.  We were told to create a rough draft by the time of the next class.   After doing the drafting activity, most of my brainstorming for the paper was already completed making the draft pretty easy to complete.  The problem that I was having was the word count of my draft was very short compared to the 1,200 word count that was required for the final.  I began to add more and more details to the paper in order to make it the correct amount of words.  Once I reached the word limit, the paper seemed kind of choppy and didn’t flow too well but it was only the draft and I am planning on continuing work on it before I turn it in for the final paper.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 6</h1>
                        <p>The assignment for this week was to continue working on the Lived Experiences project as the final is due next week.  I still had a lot of work to do to the draft before submitting it.  One of the things that I believed helped the most when editing the paper was the peer review sessions that were set up in groups on D2L.  Everyone was required to submit the draft to the work area and than review each of the papers that were submitted.  I had received some quality feedback and it was a great way to edit my paper.  Another thing that I thought had also helped a lot was being able to read other peoples papers that were also in the same class.  It had given me ideas on how to write the paper in different ways and it has made my understanding of what the paper is suppose to achieve much better.  I ended up changing a good amount of my paper from the original draft, not only in just editing grammar and small things here and there but I re-wrote some portions of my paper completely.  I had mentioned before about how I was having trouble with the detail area of my paper but looking at how others composed theirs and made it smooth and non-repetitive really helped a lot when I reviewed and edited my paper myself.  After I was done with the project, I thought it ended up being a very well written paper.  We all have to turn the paper in at midnight following the next class and I think this is a great idea for any last minute questions and help with posting it to the website.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 7</h1>
                        <p>Up to this point, I still have no idea how to create an entire html page by myself and this really worried me because the paper was due and along with it was the website page for the paper.  I’m very thankful that it wasn’t due at the time of class because I wouldn’t have been able to make it myself.  In class we all received an explanation on what we had to do for the website and tips on the coding.  A temple to given to us to post to the GitHub website and it was laid out easy enough for me to complete and turn in the paper and website on time.  Code Academy was a real help because it actually gave me an idea of what I was doing when I was working with the temple.  To have an understanding of what was going on made the process so much easier and I didn’t have much of a problem with it.  I need to complete the next track for the Code Academy for next week and it is slowly helping me learn the in’s and out’s of making an html website.  Today we were also introduced to our next project of the Cultural Analysis.  It does seem a little more complicated than the first as it is not about a personal experience or a narrative to a semi-research paper that requires you to take a side on an argument and support that with facts and information from the research.  It is not something that I haven’t done before so it shouldn’t be too hard to complete.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 8</h1>
                        <p>I started to work on the Cultural Analysis project today.  The purpose of this project is to use an artifact of technology that causes a social issue and argue the points of it.  For me it wasn’t really to hard to decide on a topic because I always hear about how video games and the negative affects it has on kids.  The drafting activity that went along with it helped me start the paper and gave me an idea of what the paper needed to have in it.  I was still a little bit confused about what the requirements of the paper are because the rubric for it seems very vague and doesn’t say specifically what it wants.  The word count to this was much larger than the first paper but from what I learned about writing in detail it had made reaching the word count easy.  As with the first project, a peer review session was used.  Again I not only got tips for my paper itself but it had given me a better understanding of what the paper needs to have in it.  For this paper, it was huge to be able to read other students papers because I was confused on what I needed to include.  What I liked about this paper is that it was more of a technical paper, more facts and information rather than a creative paper.  I am very good at being able to argue points as well, which was a big help for this project.  After finishing the paper, I think it was better than the first project and it more practice for using detail and gave some help on learning how to research correctly.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 9</h1>
                        <p>When I looked at how the Cultural Analysis had to be put onto the website, it made me worry.  Even after completing as much of the Code Academy as I have up to this point, I didn’t know how to do it.  When I got to class and realized that we were getting another web temple to put the Cultural Analysis on I relaxed about the situation.  The temple was a huge help because I wouldn’t have been able to do it myself.  We were introduced to the next project, which was the Formal Research project.  This was unlike either of the two papers in that it was a formal paper.  It was suppose to be specifically based off information and facts rather than opinion.  The opinion aspect is how it had differed from the Cultural Analysis.  The purpose of the project was to create a paper with the audience being incoming freshman students.  The paper was suppose to explain what freshman coming into the major you are pursing yourself should expect in the ways of communication and research.  A background on the major should also be present in the paper as you must give the reader the information needed to understand the rest of the paper.  Two interviews are needed for the paper with people that are involved in the major.  It would give incite onto information that wouldn’t be able to be gained from research on the topic.  I am still a little confused on everything the paper needs and the credentials but as I am better with technical papers, it doesn’t seem like to much of a daunting task.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 10</h1>
                        <p>For the formal research project, we are required to have at least two interviews with people that have knowledge pertaining to the major our paper is based off of.  The first person has to be of someone that is currently working in the field of my major.  This was an easy accomplishment for me because all it required was a phone call to one of my parents who are both mechanical engineers.  I had asked them multiple questions about engineering and how information is passed between engineers in the workplace as well as the basic principles that engineers must excel at to be successful.  All of the questions that I had asked didn’t necessarily bring up too much new information that I didn’t already know about but it was helpful in the process of compiling the project.  The second interview had to be with one of the professors here at MSU that teaches a subject pertaining to mechanical engineering.  I had asked the professor what the school teaches engineering students in order to become successful.  Much of the information that I got from this interview was a huge help for this paper because he told me that engineering classes are to help students understand the concepts of engineering.  They also help students become acquainted with the type of work environment they will work in after college like working in groups and creating technical papers.  I found myself asking questions after not only for the papers sake but also for myself.  I was asking him things of how I can better myself as a student and how I can become a better engineer.  From the interviews it gave me a lot of valuable information that I will use in my future years here at MSU and beyond that.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 11</h1>
                        <p>Completing the formal research project was a long and extensive process.  It took four weeks from start to finish.  I think the biggest challenge of this project that wasn’t apart of the previous projects was the amount of research that went into it.  It wasn’t information that is known by most but it took time and effort to find all of the information necessary to make a compelling and well-written paper.  One thing the I feel had a large help in the research was the research project that help us through a guide figure out what the best way to research.  It had called for us to research using different words and becoming more specific and less specific which ultimately improved on my research skills.  Plus it had helped me find the first few sources that I used for my research project.  Although this was a long project, I feel it connected both of the past two projects and it had also showed a deeper meaning that just being a research paper.  It had allowed for us to look deeper into our career and through research for future freshman, it had given us the knowledge to know how to become a better student in our major.  The project for me has shown me what I need to do to be a successful engineering student which will make me become a successful engineer in the workplace.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 12</h1>
                        <p>I’ve started to notice as my website grows and when I use it more that I am running into a problem.  When I was clicking that tabs at the top of the website, it would work for when I am on one page but not work when I am on different pages.  I spent a good amount of time to figure this out and it had to do with the html code navigation bar not being completely filled out for all of the separate html pages.  This was something that wasn’t talked about in the Code Academy lessons and it was something that through trial and error I had figured out on my own.  I think that because I of Code Academy, I began to understand how an html works which helped me figure out the problem much faster.  Other than that, my website seems to be working quite well.  Today in class we began to explore advertisements.  We watched multiple different ads from medication ads to sports ads and to finish it off was the Chrysler 200 ad.  The reason why these were brought up and the class was discussing them was because of our next project was going to be a video project.  I began to realize the different tactics that went into these videos to either distract from the words being said or to emphasize them.  I feel that the information that I learned today from watching these ads will help me produce a quality video for the next project.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 13</h1>
                        <p>The next project that we have been assigned is the remix project.  This project is completely different from any project we have done yet as it is a multimedia video project.  What this project has asked for us to do is to complete a video that relates back to one of the previous three projects.  Basically you are turning the paper that you wrote before into a video.  Another change in this project is that it is not an individual project but a group project.  The main problem that came up with my group and me was the ability for us to meet.  With me being on the formula SAE team, I spend a lot of time working on that as well as everyone else in the group had their own things going on.  Also the first class that the project, one of the group members was not at class and we had no way to contact him.   We had decided not to start too much until we got the opinion of the other group member but we had decided on what the video would be of.  We chose for it to be about how technology such as TVs and video games has a negative effect on children.  Once we finally met with the four member of the group and he told us his idea we changed the video to be about advertising and be a documentary because we all believed after a discussion that it would be an informative project while also being interesting.  After that was decided we created the activity to help us gather our ideas for the video and make a plot.  After this, all there was left to do was to tape it.</p>
