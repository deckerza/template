                        <p>     The purpose of this video is to promote that homosexuality is not wrong.  To show that homosexuals
                        suffer a great amount from all the hate that is given to them by people in the world that dont agree
                        with it.  To help people who are homosexual that things do get better and that suicide or other types
                        of self harm are not the answer.  To show that everything will be okay.
                        The video attempts to achieve this purpose was through reading a letter that Randy writes to his Uncle
                        that had passed away from a self inflicted gun shot wound.  The reason how this is relavent to the purpose
                        that Randy is trying to get across is because his Uncle was gay.  The reason why he had committed suicide
                        is from how much hate and resentment he had recieved from everyone who knew that he was gay.  This included
                        his father especially.  It shows that because of how much he suffered from all this hate that he though 
                        his only option was to commit suicide just to get away from the pain.  He relates it to himself and how
                        he feels that he is in the same shoes because his mother never wanted a gay son either just as his uncle
                        Ronnie's father never wanted a gay son.  He explains how bad it was and how much hurt he felt when he fist
                        announced that he was gay.  He tells that he feels in the same position that his uncle was in but in his case
                        he did not choose suicide.  He chose to live and he explains that things do get better.
                        The structure of the message is presented by first reading a poem that he had said stuck with him 
                        for most of his life.  Than he reads the letter that he wrote to his Uncle that had shared the same 
                        situation that he is currently in that realates to homosexualtiy and the hurt that he feels from being
                        that way.  After the video cuts out and that it starts again and it is him 5 years into the future and 
                        tells that it does get better.  After he puts out bold statements to really make an impact with the video
                        and emphasize his points.
                        The video structure can help me revise my Lived Experience Project by allowing me to explore that there are
                        different ways to structure my paper.  That I can switch things around and make it unknown what the purpose
                        of the paper is until the end when I tie it all together.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 2</h1>
                        <p>The video that was watched was a show of South Park that involved all of the characters obsessively involved in a video game.  It not only showed the kids being extremely into the game but also the parents.  With that being said, it seems that the group of people that is being targeted from this video is children and adults that play an extensive amounts of video games.  The video depicts the social issue that video games have to ability to capture people.   This can become as extreme as almost being another part of their lives.  They devote time to video games that they should be to other activities.  The people that get too into video games begin to loose a sense of hygiene and gain weight because all they do sit around and eat food.  One interesting aspect that was implemented into the video was the creators of the game.  Although they seemed so involved and into making the game and keeping it alive, they didn’t play the game themselves.  It showed the video game creator to have a “life” and didn’t play video games while they made the games for children to get attached to and have no “life”.  The video almost made the creators seem to encourage the social issue at hand because it was their source of income.  </p>
                        <h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
                        <p>The advertisement during the super bowl for the Chrysler 200 is a very well put together and effective advertisement.  The most effective aspect of this advertisement is that of pride and inspiration.  There are a few different ways the advertisement has incorporated this and the first is through the imagery.  Most Americans know of Detroit and the idea that it is a beat down city the almost scary reputation that it has.  The imagery at the beginning of the clip shows this story that most believe but the voice over begins to tell a different story.  It tells of how the history has made it tough, tougher and better than any other city out there.  The imagery works hand and hand with this and begins to show the images of the great aspects of Detroit.  The idea that it is tough gives a sense of pride for not only the people that live in or around it but for America itself.  It gives the sense that America built the city to what it is today and it shows that America is tough itself.  The ad finishes off with the line “Imported from Detroit”.  With the world today having so many imports from other countries, it gives the sense of pride that Americans made that car.  It shows that because Americans made the car, it is just as tough and reliable as what it gives the image Detroit and America is today.  It gives Americans watching the clip a sense of pride and ruggedness and this is what makes the watcher want to buy the car.  It shows a sense of pride to drive a car that was made right here in the motor city and it won’t have a cheap feeling but a luxurious feeling behind it.  The advertisement is effective because it makes American’s proud that they made that car and it makes them want to drive it.</p>
