			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The definition of an engineer is a person who uses a combination of not only mathematics but also science to come up with practical solutions to real world problems that are faced today. There is a design portion of engineering and a manufacturing portion to bring these designs to being actual products.  The entire process must be taken into account when considering how to solve the problems at hand.  This is because coming up with a best possible solution is not the only problem but to come up with the most practical solution while keeping the idea of the lowest cost behind every decision.  It takes technical skills to become a good engineer but it requires non-technical skills to become a successful engineer in the work place.  Communication is essential in the job environment due to the fact that engineers are always working as teams rather than working as individuals.  There are many forms of communication that are used and it includes a presentation aspect as well as the very valuable technical writing aspect.  Technical writing is specifically used for the passing along of information and it is the reason engineers use it so frequently.  It allows for knowledge to be given not only in the present date but also for it to be used in future problems that are to be solved.  Researching such data is incredibly important to engineers.  It allows for mistakes to be avoided that were previously made as well as showing possible solutions to current problems that were already solved.  As with everything in the world in recent years, technology has vastly increased the capabilities of engineering.  It has improved the ability to solve problems, improved time management, and decreased the amount of wasted money and resources.  It can be seen that engineering is an extremely complex major.  It is an incredible field to become a part of, there is never a dull moment and it will never be a job that is the same repetitive process.  Although becoming a successful engineer is a process, it should not be intimidating because it may take work but nothing good ever comes easy.  </p>
