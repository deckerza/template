			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, playing video games in excess, especially with extremely violent and inappropriate material, can cause many negative effects on children.  These negative effects include a lack in social skills, overweight children, violent or aggressive children, and a decline in academic level of children.  In the world today, children of all ages are spending more time playing video games and because of this, the negative effects of video games are growing larger and becoming more of a problem.  This is due to a combination of two major reasons: Parents are un-knowledgeable of what are in video game and of the effects of video games as well as the games on the market today can be extremely violent and inappropriate material.  Parents must become more involved and more knowledgeable of what type of video games their children are playing.  If parents become more knowledgeable of the effects of excessive amounts of video games as well as the effects of violent video games they can very well lessen or even prevent such negative effects.  Parents can limit the time playing video games and keep younger, developing children from playing violent and inappropriate video games.  Bans on extremely violent and inappropriate video games would keep children of all ages from playing such games.  This would eliminate the negative effects on children completely.  Due to the fact that it is impossible to make all parents to become more involved, it will take a combination of the two proposed solutions to help reduce the negative effects on developing children in today’s world.  It is extremely important to implement these solutions because the children of today are going to become the adults of the future.  If the path continues how it is today, the world will become full of a population of overweight adults who do not have the social skills necessary in today’s world as well as have aggressive and violent personalities. “This generation is so dead. You ask a kid, 'What are you doing this Saturday?' and they'll be playing video games or watching cable, instead of building model cars or airplanes or doing something creative…” –Jack White.</p>
