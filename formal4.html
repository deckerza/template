			<h1>Communication</h1>
			<p>All the different types of engineers all use the same method when it comes to providing information in the written form. Specifically, this written form is technical writing.  There are many different aspects of technical writing that are needed for it to be appropriately written.  One of the first aspects is that it is to be written in third person.  There cannot be any uses of first or second person and this is due mainly to the fact that when information is being passed from one engineer to another, it is not about what they did specifically.  The purpose of passing along information in engineering is for the facts and the facts only.  It does not need to be known that “your” engineering group was satisfied with the results or that “your” engineering group worked well together on the project.  It needs to be straight to the point that is specifically about the facts.  There shouldn’t be any “fluff” when it comes to writing a technical paper, all which matters when someone is reading it is the factual information.</p>
			<p>A very important aspect of writing technical papers that was brought forth from an interview with a professor in the field of engineering is that it should be clear, precise, and detailed.  Every point that is made in the paper should be obvious and clear on what is being said.  Each of the points should as well be backed with factual information that was either produced in a study, from experiences, or from information that was previously known.  This means that there shouldn’t be any opinions in the paper that are not backed by evidence.  There should be no interpretation to be left up to the reader.  A second point that was brought up by the professor is that it is extremely important to know who the audience is that will be reading the paper.  This is due to the fact that many different people could read the paper and non-engineers could even be the audience that reads the paper.  With a range of audience in mind, it is important that the paper clearly defines anything that might not already be known by the reader.  This is crucial because it keeps from leaving any interpretation up to the reader, which is a very important part of technical papers.  This keeps confusion to a minimum and keeps from different groups of people mistakenly thinking of the information in the wrong way.  </p>
			<p>It is necessary to have the skills to write technical papers but the form of communication is not always through writing papers.  With that being said, it is also just as important to have non-technical skills to become a successful engineer.  In the job environment, engineers rarely work by themselves.  It is a job that requires the use of teams to solve the problems that are faced.  A large amount of information is communicated between members of the same team as well as to other teams.  An engineer that was interviewed had a good input of advice.  It is that you should always remember that you are apart of a bigger picture.  You may work in smaller groups for the majority of the career but each group in designated specific tasks to complete.  All of the smaller tasks that each of the groups to perform are in the end put together to make a final product.  It is substantially important to understand this and it is the reason why communication is important in engineering.  Presentations will have to be made to allow for everyone to know the progress of each task.  It is also used for creative criticism; groups often come together to discuss the current status and how to improve further on it.  Communication is extremely important for any type of engineering especially for large productions.  As stated before, engineers must always realize they are apart of a bigger picture.  It is not just the task your group has at hand that matters but the entire production of the final product.  If something changes in one section, it must be passed on to other sections of the company to account for the change within their own task.  As stated before, communication within any company is extremely important but when it comes to engineering specifically, communication between the company is absolutely necessary for it to succeed.</p>
			<p>From speaking to a professor in the field of engineering as well as a engineer working in the profession today there is one thing they had both mentioned and thought was very important for any future engineers to know.  As previously stated, it is that you must understand who your audience is.  With engineering being such a complicated field it is easy to find terms or ideas that are being communicated which the person receiving information won’t understand.  Even when it comes to communicating to other engineers, some specific details might not be known.  It is extremely important to make every term specified that wouldn’t be known by the person receiving the information weather it be in a technical paper or presentation or just the passing along of information.  Engineers often times have to make presentations or need to communicate with people who aren’t engineers.   When this is the case, it is crucial to define every term that isn’t known to make sure that there aren’t any discrepancies or interpretation that is left to the reader.  This also keeps confusion to a minimum and allows for information to be passed along with the full potential that it has.  Communicating is such a large aspect of engineering, weather it be between engineers within a company or to non-engineers.  It is necessary to know the correct ways to communicate to succeed in the field of engineering.</p>
